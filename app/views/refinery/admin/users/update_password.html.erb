<h1>getting to know you!</h1>
<p>
  We’re so glad you’ve decided to join the movement of Right to Life organizations across Canada!
  LifeCollective.io is a dynamic tool thal will allow us to share content and strategies with each other in order to make a greater and longer lasting impact in our communities. 
</p>
<p>
  In order to start sharing content among various groups, we need you to create your personal account page (we’ll get to your organization’s account next).
  This is the account that you will use in order to log in to the Content Management System (CMS).
